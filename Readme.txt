Firefox is currently having issues. I'd love to support it, but it's being a nuisance. If anyone wants to attempt to get it working,
let me know.

Usage/Features
--------------

Upon navigating to neopets, you will notice some images above your active pet in the sidebar (they might take a second to show up.) Clicking them will
change the pet you see in the sidebar, along with its hunger, level, age, etc.

Additionally, the yellow, unreadable pet hp text has been changed to orange.
